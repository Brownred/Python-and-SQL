Bike Rentals is a python project that allows users to rent bikes on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis. With hourly rentals priced at $5, daily rentals at $20, and weekly rentals at $60, it provides an affordable and convenient way to enjoy the outdoor.

The project uses PostgreSQL to store important information such as customer details, transactions, and bike return information. This ensures that all data is organized and easily accessible.
